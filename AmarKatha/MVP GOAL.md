🎯 MVP GOAL
“To test if Indian comic creators and readers want a platform that prioritizes storytelling quality, creator-first tools, and consistent discovery.”

✅ Core MVP Features (Must-Have)
1. Reader App – Discovery & Reading
Feature	Why It’s Essential
🖼️ Home feed (Trending + New + Editor Picks)	Let readers discover good content quickly. Discovery is critical for trust.
📚 Comic viewer (vertical scroll or page turn)	Needed to consume content easily. Keep it smooth and mobile-first.
🔍 Search + Genre Filters	Helps readers explore by themes like “Shonen”, “Romance”, “Drama”.
➕ Follow/Subscribe to comics	Builds user–series relationship. Useful to test retention.

2. Creator Dashboard – Upload & Schedule
Feature	Why It’s Essential
🖋️ Upload chapter (image or PDF)	Basic creator publishing capability. Avoid overcomplicating it.
📆 Set chapter schedule (e.g., weekly)	Validates the habit-forming behavior.
👤 Simple creator profile page	Creates a brand space for each artist. Adds legitimacy.

3. Community & Feedback
Feature	Why It’s Essential
💬 Comment system (per chapter)	Enables reader–creator interaction. Encourages engagement.
⭐️ Simple rating (1–5 stars or like button)	Collect early quality signals for ranking later.

4. Discovery Boost Controls
Feature	Why It’s Essential
🎖️ "Editor's Picks" slot	Your manual control to promote only high-quality titles.
📈 Trending algorithm (based on read + dwell time)	To give initial momentum to good content and test traction.

5. Basic Admin Tools
Feature	Why It’s Essential
⚠️ Content moderation (basic report & remove)	Keeps platform clean and protects creator integrity.
🧠 Data dashboard (simple metrics)	Tracks: reads, subscriptions, ratings, drop-off—critical for learning.

🛑 Defer These to Later (Nice-to-Have)
Feature	Reason to Delay
Peer review system	Needs creator trust and moderation to scale. Start with ratings.
On-demand print	Operationally complex. Test digital-first success first.
Paid subscriptions / monetization	Add after you validate that people love reading here.
Multiple UI themes per category	Good polish feature, not MVP. Stick to a clean universal theme.
Community feed for doodles	Cool social layer, but avoid scope creep for MVP.
